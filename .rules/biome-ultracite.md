# Project Context
Ultracite enforces strict type safety, accessibility standards, and consistent code quality for JavaScript/TypeScript projects using Biome's lightning-fast formatter and linter.

## Key Principles
- Zero configuration required
- Subsecond performance
- Maximum type safety
- AI-friendly code generation

## Before Writing Code
1. Analyze existing patterns in the codebase
2. Consider edge cases and error scenarios
3. Follow the rules below strictly
4. Validate accessibility requirements

## Rules

### Accessibility (a11y)
- Don't use `accessKey` attribute on any HTML element.
- Don't set `aria-hidden="true"` on focusable elements.
- Don't add ARIA roles, states, and properties to elements that don't support them.
- Don't use distracting elements like `<marquee>` or `<blink>`.
- Only use the `scope` prop on `<th>` elements.
- Don't assign non-interactive ARIA roles to interactive HTML elements.
- Make sure label elements have text content and are associated with an input.
- Don't assign interactive ARIA roles to non-interactive HTML elements.
- Don't assign `tabIndex` to non-interactive HTML elements.
- Don't use positive integers for `tabIndex` property.
- Don't include "image", "picture", or "photo" in img alt prop.
- Don't use explicit role property that's the same as the implicit/default role.
- Make static elements with click handlers use a valid role attribute.
- ~~Always include a `title` element for SVG elements.~~ **DISABLED** - SVGs may be decorative
- Give all elements requiring alt text meaningful information for screen readers.
- Make sure anchors have content that's accessible to screen readers.
- Assign `tabIndex` to non-interactive HTML elements with `aria-activedescendant`.
- Include all required ARIA attributes for elements with ARIA roles.
- Make sure ARIA properties are valid for the element's supported roles.
- ~~Always include a `type` attribute for button elements.~~ **DISABLED** - Default button type is acceptable
- Make elements with interactive roles and handlers focusable.
- Give heading elements content that's accessible to screen readers (not hidden with `aria-hidden`).
- Always include a `lang` attribute on the html element.
- Always include a `title` attribute for iframe elements.
- Accompany `onClick` with at least one of: `onKeyUp`, `onKeyDown`, or `onKeyPress`.
- Accompany `onMouseOver`/`onMouseOut` with `onFocus`/`onBlur`.
- Include caption tracks for audio and video elements.
- Use semantic elements instead of role attributes in JSX.
- Make sure all anchors are valid and navigable.
- Ensure all ARIA properties (`aria-*`) are valid.
- Use valid, non-abstract ARIA roles for elements with ARIA roles.
- Use valid ARIA state and property values.
- Use valid values for the `autocomplete` attribute on input elements.
- Use correct ISO language/country codes for the `lang` attribute.

### Next.js Specific Rules
**ALL NEXT.JS RULES ARE DISABLED** - This project doesn't enforce Next.js specific patterns.

### Testing Best Practices
- Don't use export or module.exports in test files.
- Don't use focused tests.
- Make sure the assertion function, like expect, is placed inside an it() function call.
- Don't use disabled tests.

## Common Tasks
- `ultracite init` - Initialize Ultracite in your project
- `ultracite format` - Format and fix code automatically
- `ultracite lint` - Check for issues without fixing

## Configuration Notes
This project uses a customized Ultracite configuration with several rules disabled or downgraded:
- **Style rules**: More permissive around magic numbers, nested ternary, exported imports, non-null assertions, file naming, and readonly properties
- **Accessibility**: More lenient with SVG titles and button types
- **Complexity**: Allows void operators, downgrades cognitive complexity to info level
- **TypeScript**: Permits explicit any, implicit any on let, and non-null assertions
- **Performance**: Downgrades namespace imports and delete operator to warnings
- **Console usage**: Allowed for debugging and logging
- **Next.js**: All Next.js specific rules are disabled
- **Experimental features**: Most nursery rules are disabled

## Example: Error Handling
```typescript
// ✅ Good: Comprehensive error handling with console logging allowed
try {
  const result = await fetchData();
  return { success: true, data: result };
} catch (error: any) { // explicit any is allowed
  console.error('API call failed:', error); // console usage is allowed
  return { success: false, error: error.message };
}
```
